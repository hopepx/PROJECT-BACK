Any number of activities, or even a lack of regular physical activity, can bring about a crippling episode, and that&#8217;s what makes treating back pain so difficult.

He realized the significance that sacroiliac belts can play in helping the affected as they recover from painful episodes and the importance of using them alongside a carefully prescribed plan of rehabilitation. The problem was that most belts were ineffective and poorly constructed. As the years went on and more research began to support the idea of using sacroiliac belts as a way for patients to return to their previous level of function before injury, the belts that were made available to consumers refused to evolve with the times. That&#8217;s why Dr. Lawrence and his team set out to turn the sacroiliac belt market on its head, and little did they know that in doing so, they&#8217;d be starting a revolution!

Dr. Lawrence knew that sacroiliac belts provided a well-warranted measure of relief against back pain, but many relied on cheap Velcro and elastic band components. Neither material would allow users to continually adjust the brace throughout the day, and elastic would fatigue over time, losing its ability to provide support for extended periods.
